        <h1><strong>Children's Scholarship Fund Baltimore</strong></h1>
        <p>Children’s Scholarship Fund and its partner programs have provide
          scholarship since 1998, changing the lives of almost <strong>166,000</strong> children
          across the United States. CSF has funded scholarships worth <strong>$741 million</strong>
          across the country. CSF Scholars are more likely to graduate than their
          public school peers, as demonstrated by studies in the San Francisco
          Bay Area, Charlotte, Denver, and Philadelphia. Studies of CSF Scholars
          in Baltimore, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Memphis and Philadelphia found
          their <strong>test scores were higher</strong> than those of their counterparts in nearby
          public schools.

      <h1><strong>Urban Alliance Foundation</strong></h1>
      <p>The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation’s $10M investment
        to build and furnish <strong>24 new libraries</strong> over the next four to five
        years in elementary and middle schools across the city. As the number of young
        women who attend college has increased, Urban Alliance’s results show that
        we’re also <strong>closing the gender gap</strong> and increasing the likelihood of young men
        enrolling in college. Urban Alliance was awarded <strong>a five-year grant</strong> to further
        evaluate our programs; expand work in our four current regions and expand our proven
        model to a fifth jurisdiction, currently being planned.</p>
